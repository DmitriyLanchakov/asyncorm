The model object
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The model object is the key stone of the orm, it has to reside in the models.py file in each of the modules declared in the orm definition as you already know.

A model represents a table in the database (and all the relational tables required), and so should declare the data types and stats of the different columns for the complete table deffinition.
